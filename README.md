# Intended use

This repo is to help me set up a desktop or laptop machine to my liking. It is not intended for use on cloud-based machines (although a lot of the customisations are common)

To use this script, use wget/curl/browser to download
# Caveats

It's unlikely you'll be able to use this without modification due to the
hardcoded username and paths. This is intentional. My goal is to have a simple
script I can download and run.
