# Intended use

This repo is to help me set up a desktop or laptop machine to my liking. It is not intended for use on cloud-based machines (although a lot of the customisations are common).


To use this script, use wget/curl/browser to download laptop.sh and laptop.yml, then run `./laptop.sh`

One liner, suitable for copy&paste:

cd /tmp && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattpep/kickstart/main/setup.sh && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattpep/kickstart/main/setup.yml && bash ./setup.sh

# Caveats

It's unlikely you'll be able to use this without modification due to the
hardcoded username and paths. This is intentional. My goal is to have a simple
script I can download and run.

But you're welcome to use it under the terms of the license in this repostiory.
